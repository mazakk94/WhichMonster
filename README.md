GuitarHeroSongChooser
=====================

Guitar Hero Song Chooser is an expert system written with a tandem: Java + JBossDrools as a project for
Artifical Intelligence course at my university. It supports user in choosing the most proper song
for him/her to play from Guitar Hero series, taking into account personal preferences such as:
   * difficulty
   * duration
   * number of notes & more!

Most of the questions asked by system through the concluding process are contextual. Currently in database
(file assets/quiestions.yml) are something about 40 songs from GH, GH II, GH III, GH: Encores and GH: Metallica, but
it's not a problem to add more :)

####**Used technologies:**
   * Java
   * JBossDrools
   * YAML
